Hi Sian

You have been allocated an excel license for the data bootcamp, it's a Office 365 A3 for students use benefit so there are some limitations but it works for our needs. If you already have a valid, up to date excel version on your computer then you can ignore this email, but if not, you can go to  https://www.office.com and log in using the below details. This will be needed for tomorrow morning!
